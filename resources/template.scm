;;If a covariate listed in continuous_covariates or categorical_covariates 
;;is needed to run the model even when the covariate is not included in a

;;to tell scm so that it can adjust the parameterization properly

;;if [included_relations] is set, PsN will run the base model with those 
;;relations to obtain a reference ofv value to be used when computing 
;;p-values for the candidate models. If the user already knows the ofv 
;;value for the base model with included relations, time can be saved by 
;;giving scm that ofv-value on the command-line (not in the config file)
;;using option -base_ofv

;;By default option parallel_states=0 and scm tries parameterizations
;;one at a time, in the order set in valid_states. Only if the covariate
;;is included in the model with the first parameterization is the next
;;parameterization tried.
;;if parallel_states is set to 1, scm will test all possible relation 
;;forms for a parameter-covariate pair simultaneously.
